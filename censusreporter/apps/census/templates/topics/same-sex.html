<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Census Bureau does not ask questions about sexual orientation. However, responses to some questions provide data about same-sex couples. This data should not be used to draw general conclusions about gay/lesbian/bisexual Americans, but when handled with appropriate care, may still be useful for reporting.</p>
<p>
    Table <strong><a href="{% url 'table_detail' 'B11009' %}">B11009</a></strong>, <em>Unmarried-partner Households by Sex of Partner</em>, is the only table which provides information about people who have told the Census Bureau that they live with a partner of the same sex. As explained in the Census Bureau's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180525061241/https://www2.census.gov/topics/families/same-sex-couples/faq/sscplfactsheet-final.pdf">Frequently Asked Questions About Same-Sex Couple Households</a> document, responses reporting a spouse of the same sex as the house holder are changed to indicate an unmarried partner, regardless of state laws permitting same-sex marriage.

    Consult the Census Bureau's documentation for more details. Specifically, <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/families/same-sex-couples.html">American Community Survey Data on Same Sex Couples</a> provides national-level data on the household characteristics (including income, education, etc) of same-sex couples compared to married and unmarried opposite-sex couples and married couples dating back to 2005, as well as more data and methodological details.
